<h2>Part I. Introduction</h2>
<p>First paragraph: The divide between English and French Canada has historically been the source of much social tension in this country. Franco-Canadians have historically found themselves in opposition to and oppressed by the English majority. Although in recent times, the tension between these two groups have cooled, the effects can still be seen within society. In particular, the socioeconomic well-being of these communities.

<div id="limitations-and-next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations and Next Steps</h2>
<p>For the sake of transparency, a few limitations may have affected the results and conclusions made in this study. In particular, we did not take into account the province of residence of respondents. This is particularly an issue as the distribution of English and French speakers in Canada remains extremely stratified between provinces. For example, the majority of Francophones are found in Quebec and New Brunswick.[cite] Quebec is also unique in that it serves as an outlier since it is the only province with a Francophone majority.[cite] In this We also fail to take into account bilingual speakers of both English and French. This also poses an additional element of mystery as native francophones are much more likely to be bilingual than their allophone counterparts.[cite]
Finally, growing immigration from non-English nor French majority countries.</p>
<p>Future work may examine in depth socioeconomic conditions of bilingual speakers as compared to monolingual speakers. Particular care should be placed upon bilingual French-English speakers compared to monolingual French speakers.</p>
