      <description>AbstractTo varying degrees throughout history, Canadian society has generally been segregated between an English-speaking majority and a French-speaking minority. The tumultuous history between the two groups has had a long-lasting impact on the fabric of Canadian society. In our analysis of various socioeconomic factors between both groups, our findings imply that the socioeconomic gap between allophones and francophones across Canada has closed significantly.
Part I. IntroductionThe divide between English and French Canadians has historically been the source of much social tension in this country.</description>
